John HR Schuster <John.Schuster@PhoenixWorkGroup.com>
V2.1b,01/07/2016:Just A web site

This is just a simple web site to help manage a party for one of the Teradata DBA's who will be leaving us soon.

== Introduction

A simple Single Page Application (SPA) using the Bootstrap foundation.
This will be a simple project using JSON data files for the registration and messages.

== Specifications

These are very open and loose specifications.

* Bootstrap foundation
* JSON data files for Registration and Messages
* Lead page, pretty
* Jeremy introduction with picture
* Registration form section, simple name, e-mail, number of attendees
* Who is attending, from registration section, in alpha order by name
* Leave message form, simple  Name, Message
* Message list, by date ascending order
* Hosts list, to get credit
* Footer section, PLL advertisement, Developers and social links to GeekMustHave

== Tools used

This is a learning project where a number of new tools are being used.

* ATOM text editor
* GIT Plus package - Automates Local/Remote GIT processing
* Remote Sync  FTP file updates  to the HOSTing service  BlueHost in this instance


=== ATOM editor
One of the setups for this project includes the use of the ATOM text editor.
We want to be able to use one tool for GIT, GITHub and remote HOST FTP syncing.

CAUTION:  The Remote Sync adds the password in plain text to the .JSON config file.

=== GIT Plus

This is a complicated process to get SSH keys working with GIT and GitHUB.

You will need to use the GIT Bash command line to perform some of these functions.

.GIT BASH Command line
[source,bash]

  // See if you have a SSH key in the home directory
  jschust2@Recambio MINGW64 ~/Dropbox/BlueHost/JeremyIsLeaving (master)

  $ ls -al ~/.ssh
  total 36
  drwxr-xr-x 1 jschust2 197121    0 Jan 12 20:22 ./
  drwxr-xr-x 1 jschust2 197121    0 Jan 12 21:27 ../
  -rw-r--r-- 1 jschust2 197121 3243 Jan 12 21:41 id_rsa
  -rw-r--r-- 1 jschust2 197121  760 Jan 12 21:41 id_rsa.pub
  -rw-r--r-- 1 jschust2 197121 1199 Jan 12 21:53 known_hosts


If you don't have any SSH keys or you want to regenerate them then enter the following.
By using your e-mail it will mark the SSH key for better identification later.

   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "john.schuster@phoenixworkgroup.com"

When prompted for a password, leave it blank, this will simplify your use of GIT.


Make sure you are in the windows directory where the GIT repository is in and enter.

  jschust2@Recambio MINGW64 ~/Dropbox/BlueHost/JeremyIsLeaving (master)
  $ git remote
  JeremyIsLeavingWebSite  <--- This is the GITHub remote name

Next we will set the GITHUB remote to use the SSH connection rather than the HTTPS connection.

   jschust2@Recambio MINGW64 ~/Dropbox/BlueHost/JeremyIsLeaving (master)
   $ git remote set-url JeremyIsLeavingWebSite git@github.com:GeekMustHave/JeremyIsLeaving.git

Verify that it has been set correctly

  jschust2@Recambio MINGW64 ~/Dropbox/BlueHost/JeremyIsLeaving (master)
  $ git remote -v
  JeremyIsLeavingWebSite  git@github.com:GeekMustHave/JeremyIsLeaving.git (fetch)
  JeremyIsLeavingWebSite  git@github.com:GeekMustHave/JeremyIsLeaving.git (push)

Copy the SSH public key to the clipboard, in order to paste it into GitHub.

  jschust2@Recambio MINGW64 ~/Dropbox/BlueHost/JeremyIsLeaving (master)
  $ cat < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAQDhOOgz1kSzQTa4sB6a5JMN
  blah-blah-blah for many lines
  blah-blah-blah for many lines  blah-blah-blah for many lines
  blah-blah-blah for many lines
  lah-blah-blah for many lines
  blah-blah-blah for many lines
  blah-blah-blah for many lines
  blah-blah-blah for many lines
  == john.schuster@phoenixworkgroup.com

Copy from the `ssh-rsa`  to the end of the e-mail address, this is your public SSH key, it is very long.

Go to the GITHub website and login with your credentials.

Then navigate to Profile-Picture->Settings->SSH Keys->Add SSH Keys

In the `Title` area enter something to identify the SSH key like "Main Desktop Key".

Paste the SSH key text you Copied earlier, into the `Key` field.

Click `Add Key`, confirm the action with your GitHub password.

Go back to the Windows GITBash command line in order to test the connection.

  jschust2@Recambio MINGW64 ~/Dropbox/BlueHost/JeremyIsLeaving (master)
  $ ssh -T git@github.com
  Hi GeekMustHave! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

Now your GIT BASH, GIT GIU and ATOM GIT Plus should all work fine.

If you are using ATOM and you want to eliminate some the warning messages you can set the default `push` settings.
The `matching` will make git push local branches to the remote branches that already exist with the same name.

  jschust2@Recambio MINGW64 ~/Dropbox/BlueHost/JeremyIsLeaving (master)
  $ git config --global push.default matching


=== Remote Sync
